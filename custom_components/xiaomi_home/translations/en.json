When encountering issues or bugs of this integration, **you should seek help from the open-source community rather than contacting Xiaomi customer service**.\r\n3. You need some technical ability to maintain your local operating environment. The integration is not user-friendly for beginners.\r\n4. Please read the README file before starting.\n\n5.
